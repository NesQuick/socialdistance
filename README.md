# Social Distance in Charity
## Measuring social distance in charity giving through online laboratory experiment 

This is an online experiment designed for my bachelor's thesis. The experiment contained 3 sections, including a questionnaire section, a measuring social distance section and a charity giving section. The main objective of the experiment was to determine how people form their social distance regarding different charity organisations and how, therefore, this social distance influences participant's charity decisions.

I used an oTree library to create a virtual class, where participants could interact with each other. You can think of it as an analog for Google Forms. It also includes the ability to save all participants' answers to a csv file online.
